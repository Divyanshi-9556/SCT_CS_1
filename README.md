Caesar Cipher (Task 1 - Virtual Internship)

This project is part of my Cybersecurity Virtual Internship. It implements the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

Description :

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

Plaintext: HELLO

Ciphertext: KHOOR

This program allows:

Encryption of a plaintext message.

Decryption of a ciphertext message.

Custom shift values.

Features :

Encrypt messages using Caesar Cipher.

Decrypt messages back to original form.

User-defined shift key.

Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Requirements:

Python 3.x

â–¶ How to Run

Save the code as caesar_cipher.py.

Run in terminal:

python caesar_cipher.py

Enter:
A message to encrypt/decrypt

The shift key value

Example :

Enter your message: HELLO Enter shift value: 3 Encrypted: KHOOR Decrypted: HELLO

Learning Outcome :

Understood the concept of classical cryptography.

Learned how substitution ciphers work.

Built a hands-on implementation in Python.

Note: The Caesar Cipher is not secure for modern use but serves as a foundation for understanding encryption.
